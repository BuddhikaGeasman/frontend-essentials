1.  Write a function capitalize that takes a string and
    uses .map to return the same string in all caps. Write test to it.

2.  Now write a new function called swapCase that takes a string of words and uses .map and your newly written capitalize()
    function to return a string where every other word is in all caps. Write a test to test the function.
    ex: const string = 'hello world'
    will return 'hello WORLD'
